# Real-world Application Emulation
This test case consists of applications that emulate the real world applications. The distribution of some features of the selected applications, e.g., the number of functions per application, the memory usage, the execution duration, are like real world applications on Microsoft Azure. The dataset is from http://github.com/Azure/AzurePublicDataset 

## Memorandum
* The sample of "chainLen" is generated through `sampleGenerator.py`, according to `chainlenCDF.csv` generated by `chainlenCDFGenerator.py`.  
* Next, we need to do (2020/10/10):

    * Generate the CDF of memory footprint and execution time
    * Update function.py, which is responsible to generate a random memory usage and execution time that satisfy the CDF.
    * Update a helper binary executable file, which is responsible to consume the designated amount of memory according to the parameter passed by function.py. The function.py can do the execution job by itself or by the helper binary
    * The function.py, the helper binary executable file, the CDF file should be uploaded together.
