# Real-world Application Emulation
This test case consists of applications that emulate the real world applications. The distribution of some features of the selected applications, e.g., the number of functions per application, are like real world applications on Microsoft Azure. The dataset is from http://github.com/Azure/AzurePublicDataset 

Emulate four aspects of real-world application:
* The number of functions per application
* The memory usage
* The execution dutation
* The invoke pattern about the frequency and distribution on function.
